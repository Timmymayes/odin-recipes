# odin-recipes
Recipes project for The Odin Project

In this project I'll be building a basic webpage for displaying some recipes. At the completion of this project I'll be
showcasing the following skills:

 - Starting a new repo and cloning it to my local machine.
 - Creating a proper starting base of boilerplate html and initial directory structure
 - Understanding of the <img>, <a> and various header tags.
 - Will not worry too much about styling for now as weLl dive into css later
