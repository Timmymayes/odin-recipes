    <h3>Your very first hummus</h3>
      <p>Roasted Red Pepper Hummus is a great dip to have on hand. It can be made rather quickly with a few ingredients kept on hand in your pantry and a couple of fresh peppers. This is a solid base hummus for your repitoire. But keep in mind that you can make a lot of different flavors of hummus by simply replacing the roasted red peppers with a different accent ingredient. Some ideas to pique your interest are below.

	<ul>
	  
	  <li>Roasted Garlic</li>
	  
	  <li>Jalapeno</li>
	  
	  <li>Lemon (or plain)</li>
	  
	  <li>Everything Bagel</li>
	  
	  
	  <li>And many more...</li>

      Hummus is best served warm right after making it with a sprinkle of paprika.
